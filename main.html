      Dr. Bhaskar Bannerjee (Amitabh Bachchan) struggles with his patients'
      suffering and the darkness and poverty he confronts daily in his native
      India. He treats a cancer patient, Anand Saigal (Rajesh Khanna), who upon
      learning of his impending death determines to use the time he has left to
      the absolute fullest. Bannarjee's experience with the patient leaves a
      profound impression on him, and so he writes a heartrending bestseller
      based on recorded interviews with Anand.
